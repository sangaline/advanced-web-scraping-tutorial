This is a [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) web scraper for the fictional Zipru torrent site.
It is designed to bypass four distinct anti-scraping mechanisms:

1. User agent filtering.
2. Obfuscated javascript redirects.
3. Captchas.
4. Header consistency checks.

The scraper is not actually functional because Zipru is not a real site.
The code, however, is otherwise complete and can easily be adapted to work on other sites.
